		<strong><h3>"Marketplace Is the Most Beautiful Business Model in the World.</h3></strong>

		At Tokopedia, we believe that marketplace is the most beautiful business model in the world, because the success of a marketplace can only be achieved by helping others to become more successful. 

		Our services have allowed hundreds of thousands of Indonesian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to send millions of products every month to their customers throughout Indonesia. Tokopedia is also indirectly responsible for the creation of thousands of new jobs through the growing success of our merchants, who often become a positive impact by providing job vacancies in their immediate communities.

		<strong><h3>Indonesian Internet Company with a Global Vision</h3></strong>

		Tokopedia is the first internet company in Southeast Asia that succeeded to close US$100 million in funding from Softbank and Sequoia Capital. Softbank is the investor behind the success of Alibaba, while Sequoia Capital is the investor behind the success of Apple, Google, Instagram, WhatsApp and many other successful technology companies.
	
		We believe that we are in the process of building a World Class Technology Company which fortunately happens to be in Indonesia.
